The Git repository root folder should contain 4 subfolders:
- messaging
- database
- backend
- frontend

The manual deployment process:
- clone/pull the Git repository to each virtual machine
- Run scripts from the appropriate folder
  - to install software like the RabbitMQ, database server, Python, libraries and other dependencies, and
  - to run messaging, database, backend and frontend services.
- Code/scripts in each of the 4 subfolders should not depend on the other 3 subfolders
